Bro ShinChan is still around!?!
"Good i live in india, shinchan is airing 24/7 here. But sadly not the new episodes."
bruh shinchan havent watch it ever since I was a kid
Shinchan my childhood
"New episodes are still airing, now shinchan has like 1100+ episodes, sadly, people outside Japan cant really see the very latest episodes that easily  
But I remember watching episode 902, and it was as funny as the beginning episodes of shin chan (i watched it with JP audio+eng subs)  
Shin chan still nails it, thats all I can say"
It's a shame really. They know shinchan is performing really well here and yet they haven't got the license to new episodes and had them dubbed? Do they hate money? Lol
shinchan adult empire strikes back
Shinchan can never be disappointed üòÇ
Well I don't think anyone has done english subs of shinchan hindi dub tho. I remember there were some english subs of shinchan on TV but it was quickly gone after like 10 days or something. Well I guess it would take the op that post it to translate it into an eng sub which can take some time.
Or we could create a other community for shinchan india
"
Edit:- now that most people here are old, you'd like to know that shinchan comes under the seinen category and was heavily censored to make it fit for the Indian audience. But if you'd watch the original with dub, maybe it'll ruin your good memories of the show, or maybe you'll like it, Idk whatever suits you.
You do you, idk even care about this cartoon 

What's funny to me is that these Indian folks are just self entitled pieces of boo boo or they are just too stupid to read subtitles of the Japanese version of Shinchan movies or the show in general. And then yap about why it's not in their language, like wtf. 
And OP is right, there are much better movies than Hinderland or Jungle In The Bungle, but people here are just too lazy to look out."
"Almost all Shinchan movies have eng sub versions available, just go to the website you regularly watch anime on and see from there"
That is a nightmarish suggestion! Why do Indian subs use Hindi and make it unwelcoming to non-Hindi speakers? Make ShinchanHindi if you must!
"all of us grew up watching shinchan in hindi dub and have watched it in hindi our entire life ,so obviously it would be weird for us to watch it in jap dub with eng sub"
I never dislike shinchan üôÇ
"Adult empire was very engaging and i loved it.
Haven't watched the second one though. Since I've watched all Shinchan's movies released in India and most of those that weren't,I can say I barely found any of them to be any less interesting. However I personally find alien shiriri, singing buttocks and robot dad to be one time watches."
Shinchan is epic in every universe üî•
Guys tell me names of your favourite Shinchan movies so I can watch/rewatch
"Shinchan buri buri charge was boring 
The movie was all about pop culture in Japan like kaijus and waifus and there is no story behind it
It's like a nohara family fuse with Godzilla toy and fight with kaijus then it repeats again and again"
Spain Korea and India have some crazy Shinchan fans
"FYI I Used to watch Hindi dub in school days, after getting job and started watching anime, I watch JP original dub every week, I'm on 1269, need to watch the latest one (1270) and yes I watched every movie in original dub till Shin jigen.( Waiting for dinosaur diary)

Don't judge anyone based on your assumptions, I know some are boring episodes & movies but I never hate shinchan"
"Chill bro, we love Shinchan, we are bros. ü´Ç"
"I use TV Asahi to watch episodes, I got it from my friend who works in Japan. But you can search shinchan PUX, they used to upload raw episodes without subtitles though."
"I watch on tv asahi, my friend lives/works in Japan and he bought it's subscription, so I'm using it with VPN. But I do remember there was a telegram channel/site called shinchan PUX, they used to upload raw, I don't know if they still upload."
It‚Äôs alright bro I was being too harsh we good love Shinchan for life ü´Ç
"Bro I don't have enough time to learn japanese, so watching raw  shinchan episodes without subtitles would basically mean same as not watching them at all."
"Not even an S for yakiniku road of honour? Jungle that invites storm is an S atleast. Evening boys of Kasukabe and B-Class gourmet food is my favourite so SS to those too¬†
Action kamen vs leotard devil and pursuit of balls of darkness deserve an A too. Too many good shinchan movies man¬†"
Ig adult empire strikes back is a tier above any shinchan film
‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏èShinchan signs a paper that makes aliens take Himawari as their princess to another planet. The Nohara family gets involved in a fun space adventure to bring her back. I love the movie.
"Nah, she‚Äôs seen as lazy from shinchan‚Äôs pov because she takes a nap in the afternoon after cooking, cleaning and getting shinchan ready for school (even helping harry get ready for office and cooking his tiffin as well). Not to mention dealing with a newborn.¬†"
Chako changed her name to Jacqueline Finley and saved Shinchan from samba clones
Even the msala story chase shinchan's cycle wheels break and he learns how to ride 2 wheel cycle and there are tons of cyclists who crash because of him lmao
